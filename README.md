### Stratis ICO Platform
The Stratis ICO (Initial Coin Offering) Platform allows you to run a secure and flexible web-based application that enables buyers to purchase your tokens before the point of initial allocation. Your tokens are purchased (or earned) by buyers when they contribute in either BTC or STRAT while the ICO is live. For more information on the workflow and the components involved with the ICO Platform, please refer to the [ICO Platform Overview document](https://github.com/stratisproject/ICO-Platform/blob/master/Documentation/Stratis%20ICO%20Platform%20Overview.pdf).

Features of the ICO Platform include:

- A highly customizable design, which enables you to ensure the ICO site conforms with your unique branding.

- The ability to accept funds in USD, BTC, STRAT and 50+ additional cryptocurrencies via Changelly, a service that enables ICO contributors to pay in many digital currencies.

- Integration with Onfido’s ‘Know-Your-Customer’ (KYC) service that screens contributors against anti-money laundering watch-lists and undertakes document checks.

- IPStack integration allowing you to block citizens in selected countries from registering, in addition, the service is also able to detect Tor Traffic and VPN's.

- Hierarchical Deterministic (HD), enabling issuers to collect funds securely. This means the funds collected during the ICO are not stored on the server itself.

- The Stratis ICO Platform is provided free of charge, overcoming the high costs of existing crowd-funding solutions.
